# ezplist

A simple, quick way to find and view all .plist files in an IPA file

When reversing iOS binaries, I always found reviewing plist files to be less than optimal.
The script automates the simple steps required to find and view all plist files within an IPA file.
There is an option to save the output to an xml file for later viewing.

Please let me know of any issues or suggestions.
